# 🧬 MSA-Classifier Mask Pipeline for Antimicrobial Peptide Design
..
This repository provides a **Google Colab–ready pipeline** for the design, screening, and structural filtering of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) variants.

The workflow integrates:
- BLAST against AMPDB
- Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)–based conservation
- Mask enumeration and variant generation
- AMPSorter activity prediction
- NetSurfP-3.0 secondary structure prediction
- Q8-based SOV structural filtering

The pipeline is designed to run **entirely in Google Colab** and relies on **external tools and datasets stored in Google Drive**.
